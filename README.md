# Frontend Mentor - Todo app
## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
# MY PROCESS
### BUILT WITH
  This project was done using:
  - VITE
  - REACT (TYPESCRIPT)
  - SASS
  - CODUX: To check if the component were working as expected
 - React beautiful dnd: for drag and drop
 ## WHAT I LEARNED
 I learn how how to do drag  and drop although it is some hell of a patch work I did
 I learned how to use typescript [like types: it's so cool yet it feels so alien] but I know how I'm never going back just javascript
 I definitely got to use a bunch of hooks for the first time like useCallback, useMemo, FormEvent, useReducer etc
 I ran into a few problems with the app:
  - Writing the filters and taskreducer
  - You might see some error popup for  the drag and drop if you have any solution pls comment on it
 This is my first time implementing the drag and drop into a project and doing theme using react so It waas quite a journey reading through documentation like crazy
